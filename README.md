# Flow Planner ðŸ‘¾
Generative trajectory synthesis via flow matching. 

## Setup
Create the conda environment and activate it:

```bash
conda env create -f frl.yml
conda activate frl
```

## Makefile Targets
The Makefile in `src` exposes several commands:

- `make fm` â€“ run the flow-matching experiment (`experiments/fm.sh`).
- `make train` â€“ train a PPO agent using `experiments/lunarlander/train.sh`.
- `make eval` â€“ evaluate a trained model via `pipelines/lunarlander/eval.py`.
- `make collect_dataset` â€“ generate a Minari dataset with `pipelines/lunarlander/collect_dataset.py`.
- `make baseline_bc` â€“ train a simple behavioural cloning policy.
- `make fm_bc` â€“ behavioural cloning using the flow-matching pipeline.
- `make clean` â€“ remove models, runs and temporary files.

Run these commands from the `src` directory.

## Pipeline Scripts
The `src/pipelines/lunarlander` folder contains helper scripts:

- `collect_dataset.py` â€“ loads a trained PPO agent and records episodes to build a Minari dataset.
- `baseline_bc.py` â€“ trains a basic MLP policy on the collected dataset.
- `fm_bc.py` â€“ behavioural cloning with flow matching.
- `eval.py` â€“ evaluates a saved model on LunarLander and prints statistics.
- `preprocessing.py` â€“ utilities for normalising datasets and creating training chunks.
